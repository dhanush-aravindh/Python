# How strings work in python and how to input something in a variable
# Valid Syntax:
print("I love prepInsta prime course for python")
print('It starts from basics')
print('I "Personally" loving it a lot')
print("It's easy to include 'single Quotes' also")

# Invalid syntax:
# print("I love you "Dhanush"")
# print('I love my nation 'India'')

# Using variable
variable="Your name is:"
name = input("Enter your name:")
print(variable + " " + name)
print(variable+name)

# Instead of printing the name we want the user to tell his name
my_name = input("Your name is:")
print(my_name)
